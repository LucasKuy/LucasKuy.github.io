                <p class="summary">
                    I am a Computer Systems Technician and Software Support student at Mohawk College.
                    I am in my third semester and I have been on the Dean's Honour List twice.
                    I have experience building tools in Python, C sharp, Java, PHP, and web technologies.
                    I care about clear code, testing, and reliable results.
                    During my co op term at Wessuc Inc. I created internal applications that helped with fuel costing,
                    repair scheduling, and camera photo tracking for accounting staff and field teams.
                    I am interested in junior and entry level software developer roles where I can keep learning,
                    contribute to useful projects, and work with experienced developers.
